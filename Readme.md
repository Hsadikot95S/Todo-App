# Todo List Application

A simple and interactive todo list application built with Flask and MongoDB. This application allows users to register, login, add, edit, complete, and delete todo tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks with details like priority level, tags, creation and due date.
- Edit existing tasks.

- View only completed tasks.
- Export completed tasks to CSV.
- Receive reminders on tasks' due date if alarm is set.
