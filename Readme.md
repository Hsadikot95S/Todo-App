## Features

- User Registration and Login.
- Add tasks with details like priority level, tags, creation and due date.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks.
- View only completed tasks.
- Export completed tasks to CSV.
- Receive reminders on tasks' due date if alarm is set.
